    "Ans :- DEADLOCK\n",
    "A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways in which you may encounter a deadlock in your concurrent program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks are not developed intentionally, instead, they are an unexpected side effect or bug in concurrency programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice).\n",
    "Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A).\n",
    "Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock, semaphore, barrier, condition, event, etc.).\n",
    "Threads that acquire mutex locks in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "RACE CONDITIONS\n",
    "This is one of the major issues in concurrent programming. Concurrent access to shared resources can lead to race condition. A race condition may be defined as the occurring of a condition when two or more threads can access shared data and then try to change its value at the same time. Due to this, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes.\n"
